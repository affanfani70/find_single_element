# find_single_element
**Given an array of integers where each element appears twice except for one element which appears only once, design an algorithm to find that single element. However, there are additional constraints:

-> XOR operation cannot be used.
-> Dictionaries or frequency counting cannot be utilized.
-> Only a single iteration through the array is not permitted.**
